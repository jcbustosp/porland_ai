# Portland AI

The objective is to define a system that enables users to directly query the datasets stored in Portland using natural language, and obtain relevant and correct results.

## Core functionality Evaluation

The core functionality of the system is its ability to interpret natural language input and accurately retrieve relevant data from the database - this module contains code exploring this core functionality.

## TO DO

- Defining a new list of questions based on questions raised over previous OpCos. 
- Evaluate performances over this list of questions.
  - Look at `toolfront` performance without and with context. Context should come from our internal tables metadata and/or static general knowledge.
