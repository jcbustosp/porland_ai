Focus on retention and upselling to counter the decline.\n\n2. **Belgium (BE)**:  \n   - **GTV and orders**: Both fell by 40%, but average order value remained stable at ~30\u20ac.  \n   - **Implication**: Decline is due to fewer orders, not lower spend. Target increasing order frequency.\n\n3. **Great Britain (GB)**:  \n   - **GTV and orders**: Both dropped by ~40%, with average order value falling from 18.6\u20ac to 16.9\u20ac.  \n   - **Implication**: Price sensitivity or competition is likely. Consider promotions or loyalty initiatives.\n\n4. **Netherlands (NL)**:  \n   - **No change**: GTV and orders remained flat, with stable average order value (~24.6\u20ac).  \n   - **Implication**: Small market size; prioritize monitoring for potential expansion.\n\n### Key Trends:  \n- **Overall contraction**: All regions experienced 30\u201340% drops in GTV and orders, indicating a broader market slowdown.  \n- **France\u2019s dominance**: Despite being the largest market, France\u2019s share of total GTV is shrinking.  \n- **Belgium and GB**: Declines are linked to reduced order frequency, not lower spend.  \n- **Netherlands**: Minimal activity suggests low priority for aggressive growth.  \n\n**Conclusion**: The decline is widespread, with France facing the most significant challenges. Strategies should focus on retaining customers in France, boosting order frequency in Belgium, and addressing price sensitivity in GB. The Netherlands remains a low-priority market."
