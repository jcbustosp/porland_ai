- What are the main drivers behind the high daily liquidity outflows observed during the last two days of June 2025? Look at large-impact negative transactions to explain the outflows.

   Answer:

      `tar` must receive the exclude pattern before it expands the file list.  
      Quote the pattern (so the shell does not split it) and put the option
      before the files to archive.

      ```bash
      tar -cvzf archive.tar.gz --exclude='my file.txt' *
      # or
      tar -cvzf archive.tar.gz --exclude='my file.txt' .
      ```

      The `--exclude='my file.txt'` option tells tar to skip that file, and the
      quotes keep the space from being treated as a separator. This correctly
      excludes a file whose name contains a space.
