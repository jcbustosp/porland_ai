{"Querying with Agent + Context": {"What are the main drivers behind the high daily liquidity outflows observed during the last two days of June 2025? Look at large-impact negative transactions to explain the outflows.": "\n\nThe high daily liquidity outflows observed on the last two days of June 2025 were primarily driven by large negative transactions:\n\n1. **2025-06-24**  \n   - **Total negative volume**: \u20ac-1,715,055.33  \n   - **Largest impact**: A single transaction of \u20ac-1,700,000.95 from account `DE06********0200 EUR` dominated the outflow.  \n\n2. **2025-06-25**  \n   - **Total negative volume**: \u20ac-3,388,309.69  \n   - **Largest impact**: The largest transaction was \u20ac-371,981.16 from account `DE58********9400 EUR`, though multiple smaller negative transactions likely contributed to the higher total.  \n\nThese large negative transactions appear to be the primary drivers of the liquidity outflows during those days.", "What is the average variation in end-of-month total liquidity balances during the six-month period before March 2025 ?": "\n\nThe average monthly variation in end-of-month total liquidity balances during the six-month period from October 2024 to February 2025 was **\u2212$2.06 million** (a decrease of approximately **$2.06 million per month** on average). This reflects a consistent downward trend in liquidity during the period.", "What is the change in the trend of transaction outflows from March to May 2025 compared to December 2024 to February 2025 for the client headquarters accounts (i.e., the 'patient21_se' legal entity)?": "\n\nThe total transaction outflows for the **patient21_se** legal entity show a **decrease of \u20ac1.5 million** between the two periods:\n\n- **March\u2013May 2025**: \u20ac15,388,237.48 outflow  \n- **December 2024\u2013February 2025**: \u20ac18,420,992.67 outflow  \n\nThis represents a **1.5 million euro reduction** (or ~8.3% decrease) in outflows during the March\u2013May 2025 period compared to the prior 5-month window.  \n\nThe results are based on the `saltedge_transactions` table, filtered for negative amounts and the legal entity `Patient21 SE` (case-sensitive).
