Aggregated the `lower_bound_balance_in_covenant_currency` per month to get each month\u2019s total liquidity.  \n3. Calculated month\u2011to\u2011month changes (current month total minus previous month total).  \n4. Took the absolute value of each change and averaged them across the five month\u2011to\u2011month intervals.  \n\nThe final average variation is **$65,548,171.05**.", "What is the change in the trend of transaction outflows from March to May 2025 compared to December 2024 to February 2025 for the client headquarters accounts (i.e., the 'patient21_se' legal entity)?": "**Key result**\n\n- **Change in trend of transaction outflows (March\u2011May\u202f2025 vs. December\u202f2024\u2011February\u202f2025)**:  \n  **+\u202f1,010,918.40\u202fEUR** (outflows became less negative by about 1.01\u202fmillion EUR).\n\n**How the result was obtained**\n\n1.

Calculated the average monthly outflow for each period.  \n4. Subtracted the earlier\u2011period average from the later\u2011period average, yielding a positive change of **+1,010,918.40\u202fEUR**.  \n\nThe calculation used the monthly totals:\n\n| Period | Avg. outflow (EUR) |\n|--------|--------------------|\n| Dec\u202f2024 \u2013 Feb\u202f2025 | \u20136,140,330.89 |\n| Mar\u202f2025 \u2013 May\u202f2025 | \u20135,129,412.49 |\n\nThe positive difference indicates a trend toward lower outflows in the later period."}}
