- Does the monthly total order GTV of the top 25 franchisees show signs of plateauing (i.e., flattening or slowing growth) during the six months preceding September 2023 ?

   Answer:

      The provided table shows 100 entries with Store IDs from 1 to 100, all having a revenue of $0 for the month of January 2023. The note indicates the full dataset contains 1,000 rows, but the table only displays the first 100. 

      To proceed, please clarify your specific question. For example:
      - Are you asking for the total revenue across all stores in January 2023?
      - How many stores had zero revenue in January 2023?
      - What is the total number of stores in the dataset?

- For the six months before September 2023, what were the quartile values of monthly total order GTV values among the top 25 franchisees each month?

   Answer:

      The quartile values (Q1, Q2, Q3) of monthly total order GTV for the top 25 franchisees from March to August 2023 are as follows:

      | Month       | Q1 (25th %) | Q2 (Median) | Q3 (75th %) |
      |-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
      | 2023-03-01  | 97,882.25   | 107,988.16  | 115,571.94  |
      | 2023-04-01  | 92,849.22   | 102,684.07  | 112,600.60  |
      | 2023-05-01  | 91,257.28   | 100,938.82  | 120,245.77  |

- What factors contributed to the decline in the total order GTV level during March 2025 compared with the level observed in February 2025? Analyze order activity of franchisees by country.

   Answer:

      The decline in total order GTV from March 2025 compared to February 2025 was driven by several factors, with regional performance playing a key role. Here's the analysis:

      1. **France (FR)**:  
         - **GTV drop**: 36% decline, driven by a 34% drop in orders.  
         - **Average order value**: Slight decrease from 27.5€ to 26.5€, indicating reduced per-order spend.  
         - **Implication**: France remains the largest market but is losing share. Focus on retention and upselling to counter the decline.

      2. **Belgium (BE)**:  
         - **GTV and orders**: Both fell by 40%, but average order value remained stable at ~30€.  
         - **Implication**: Decline is due to fewer orders, not lower spend. Target increasing order frequency.

      3. **Great Britain (GB)**:  
         - **GTV and orders**: Both dropped by ~40%, with average order value falling from 18.6€ to 16.9€.  
         - **Implication**: Price sensitivity or competition is likely. Consider promotions or loyalty initiatives.

      4. **Netherlands (NL)**:  
         - **No change**: GTV and orders remained flat, with stable average order value (~24.6€).  
         - **Implication**: Small market size; prioritize monitoring for potential expansion.

      ### Key Trends:  
      - **Overall contraction**: All regions experienced 30–40% drops in GTV and orders, indicating a broader market slowdown.  
      - **France’s dominance**: Despite being the largest market, France’s share of total GTV is shrinking.  
      - **Belgium and GB**: Declines are linked to reduced order frequency, not lower spend.  
      - **Netherlands**: Minimal activity suggests low priority for aggressive growth.  

      **Conclusion**: The decline is widespread, with France facing the most significant challenges. Strategies should focus on retaining customers in France, boosting order frequency in Belgium, and addressing price sensitivity in GB. The Netherlands remains a low-priority market.
