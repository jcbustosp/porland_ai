- What are the main drivers behind the high daily liquidity outflows observed during the last two days of June 2025? Look at large-impact negative transactions to explain the outflows.

   Answer:

      The high daily liquidity outflows observed on the last two days of June 2025 were primarily driven by large negative transactions:

      1. **2025-06-24**  
         - **Total negative volume**: €-1,715,055.33  
         - **Largest impact**: A single transaction of €-1,700,000.95 from account `DE06********0200 EUR` dominated the outflow.  

      2. **2025-06-25**  
         - **Total negative volume**: €-3,388,309.69  
         - **Largest impact**: The largest transaction was €-371,981.16 from account `DE58********9400 EUR`, though multiple smaller negative transactions likely contributed to the higher total.  

      These large negative transactions appear to be the primary drivers of the liquidity outflows during those days.

- What is the average variation in end-of-month total liquidity balances during the six-month period before March 2025 ?

   Answer:

      The average monthly variation in end-of-month total liquidity balances during the six-month period from October 2024 to February 2025 was **−$2.06 million** (a decrease of approximately **$2.06 million per month** on average). This reflects a consistent downward trend in liquidity during the period.

- What is the change in the trend of transaction outflows from March to May 2025 compared to December 2024 to February 2025 for the client headquarters accounts (i.e., the 'patient21_se' legal entity)?

   Answer:

      The total transaction outflows for the **patient21_se** legal entity show a **decrease of €1.5 million** between the two periods:

      - **March–May 2025**: €15,388,237.48 outflow  
      - **December 2024–February 2025**: €18,420,992.67 outflow  

      This represents a **1.5 million euro reduction** (or ~8.3% decrease) in outflows during the March–May 2025 period compared to the prior 5-month window.  

      The results are based on the `saltedge_transactions` table, filtered for negative amounts and the legal entity `Patient21 SE` (case-sensitive). Let me know if you'd like further analysis!
