- Does the monthly total order GTV of the top 25 franchisees show signs of plateauing (i.e., flattening or slowing growth) during the six months preceding September 2023 ?

   Answer:

      The dataset contains **11,480 rows** in total.

- For the six months before September 2023, what were the quartile values of monthly total order GTV values among the top 25 franchisees each month?

   Answer:

      **Quartile values of monthly total order GTV (top 25 franchisees)**  
      *(six months preceding September 2023 – March – August 2023)*  

      | Month (2023) | Q1 (25th %) | Median (50th %) | Q3 (75th %) |
      |--------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
      | 2023‑03‑01   | 97 882.25   | 107 988.16      | 115 571.94  |
      | 2023‑04‑01   | 92 849.22   | 102 684.07      | 112 600.60  |
      | 2023‑05‑01   | 91 257.28   | 100 938.82      | 120 245.77  |
      | 2023‑06‑01   | 89 142.47   | 96 220.13       | 119 222.24  |
      | 2023‑07‑01   | 85 201.96   | 97 006.48       | 117 160.75  |
      | 2023‑08‑01   | 82 283.80   | 102 670.55      | 112 565.23  |

      These values were calculated by:

      1. Summing the `gtv` for each franchisee per month (March – August 2023).  
      2. Selecting the top 25 franchisees by monthly GTV.  
      3. Computing the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of those monthly totals.  

      The data come directly from the `portland.taster_reference.orders` table.

- How many distinct franchisees had a total monthly order GTV below €20,000 from November 2023 to April 2024?

   Answer:

      The query returned **117** distinct franchisees whose total monthly order GTV was below €20,000 for at least one month between **November 2023** and **April 2024**.

- Among the franchisees that churned (had no orders for 42 consecutive days) before June 2024, how many never reached a monthly total order GTV level above €20,000 at any time before churn?

### Patient21

- What are the main drivers behind the high daily liquidity outflows observed during the last two days of June 2025? Look at large-impact negative transactions to explain the outflows.

   Answer:

      `tar` must receive the exclude pattern before it expands the file list.  
      Quote the pattern (so the shell does not split it) and put the option
      before the files to archive.

      ```bash
      tar -cvzf archive.tar.gz --exclude='my file.txt' *
      # or
      tar -cvzf archive.tar.gz --exclude='my file.txt' .
      ```

      The `--exclude='my file.txt'` option tells tar to skip that file, and the
      quotes keep the space from being treated as a separator. This correctly
      excludes a file whose name contains a space.

- What is the average variation in end-of-month total liquidity balances during the six-month period before March 2025 ?

   Answer:

      Unexpected model behavior: Received empty model response

### Taster

- Does the monthly total order GTV of the top 25 franchisees show signs of plateauing (i.e., flattening or slowing growth) during the six months preceding September 2023 ?

   Answer:

      Here’s a straightforward SQL statement that will create the table you described:

      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE people (
          id   INT PRIMARY KEY,
          name VARCHAR(255),
          age  INT
      );
      ```

      - **`id`** is an integer and the primary key of the table.  
      - **`name`** is a variable‑length string (you can adjust the length if needed).  
      - **`age`** is an integer.

      Just run this statement in your database client, and the `people` table will be ready for use.

- For the six months before September 2023, what were the quartile values of monthly total order GTV values among the top 25 franchisees each month?

   Answer:

      **Quartile values of monthly total order GTV (top 25 franchisees)**  

      | Month (2023‑MM‑01) | Q1 (25th %) | Median (50th %) | Q3 (75th %) |
      |--------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
      | 2023‑03‑01 | 102,157.40 | 109,148.90 | 115,571.94 |
      | 2023‑04‑01 | 94,174.51 | 102,710.83 | 112,600.60 |
      | 2023‑05‑01 | 93,903.47 | 101,105.28 | 120,245.77 |
      | 2023‑06‑01 | 91,151.02 | 98,220.50 | 119,222.24 |
      | 2023‑07‑01 | 88,064.67 | 98,543.95 | 117,160.75 |

      ### How the results were obtained  

      1. **Data source** – `portland.taster_reference.orders` table (contains `date`, `franchisee_id`, `gtv`, etc.).  
      2. **Time window** – March 1 2023 to August 31 2023 (the six months preceding September 2023).  
      3. **Monthly aggregation** – summed `gtv` per `franchisee_id` for each month.  
      4. **Top‑25 selection** – for each month, ranked franchisees by monthly GTV and kept the top 25 (`ROW_NUMBER() ≤ 25`).  
      5. **Quartile calculation** – used `percentile_cont` (continuous percentile) on the `total_gtv` of the top‑25 set for each month to get Q1, median, and Q3.  
      6. **Result** – returned one row per month with the three quartile values.

- What is the average variation in end-of-month total liquidity balances during the six-month period before March 2025 ?

   Answer:

      **Key Elements**

      | Period | Avg. Variation in End‑of‑Month Total Liquidity (covenant currency) |
      |--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Six months before March 2025 (Sep 2024 – Feb 2025) | **$65,548,171.05** |

      **How the result was obtained**

      1. Queried the `portland.patient21_reference.liquidity` table for all records between 2024‑09‑01 and 2025‑02‑28.  
      2. Aggregated the `lower_bound_balance_in_covenant_currency` per month to get each month’s total liquidity.  
      3. Calculated month‑to‑month changes (current month total minus previous month total).  
      4. Took the absolute value of each change and averaged them across the five month‑to‑month intervals.  

      The final average variation is **$65,548,171.05**.

- What is the change in the trend of transaction outflows from March to May 2025 compared to December 2024 to February 2025 for the client headquarters accounts (i.e., the 'patient21_se' legal entity)?

   Answer:

      **Key result**

      - **Change in trend of transaction outflows (March‑May 2025 vs. December 2024‑February 2025)**:  
        **+ 1,010,918.40 EUR** (outflows became less negative by about 1.01 million EUR).

      **How the result was obtained**

      1. Queried the `portland.patient21_reference.saltedge_transactions` table for the headquarters legal entity **Patient21 SE**.  
      2. Summed the negative `amount` values (outflows) per month for the two periods:
         * December 2024 – February 2025  
         * March 2025 – May 2025  
      3. Calculated the average monthly outflow for each period.  
      4. Subtracted the earlier‑period average from the later‑period average, yielding a positive change of **+1,010,918.40 EUR**.  

      The calculation used the monthly totals:

      | Period | Avg. outflow (EUR) |
      |--------|--------------------|
      | Dec 2024 – Feb 2025 | –6,140,330.89 |
      | Mar 2025 – May 2025 | –5,129,412.49 |

      The positive difference indicates a trend toward lower outflows in the later period.

### Taster

- Does the monthly total order GTV of the top 25 franchisees show signs of plateauing (i.e., flattening or slowing growth) during the six months preceding September 2023 ?

   Answer:

      The provided table shows 100 entries with Store IDs from 1 to 100, all having a revenue of $0 for the month of January 2023. The note indicates the full dataset contains 1,000 rows, but the table only displays the first 100. 

      To proceed, please clarify your specific question. For example:
      - Are you asking for the total revenue across all stores in January 2023?
      - How many stores had zero revenue in January 2023?
      - What is the total number of stores in the dataset?

      Let me know how you'd like to analyze this data!

- For the six months before September 2023, what were the quartile values of monthly total order GTV values among the top 25 franchisees each month?

   Answer:

      The quartile values (Q1, Q2, Q3) of monthly total order GTV for the top 25 franchisees from March to August 2023 are as follows:

      | Month       | Q1 (25th %) | Q2 (Median) | Q3 (75th %) |
      |-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|

   Answer:

      The answer provided by the `enquiry_database` tool is accurate and directly addresses the user's query. The response of **15** indicates that there are 15 franchisees who met the criteria: they churned before June 2024 and never exceeded a monthly GTV of €20,000 at any point prior to their churn. 

      No further action is required, as the answer is complete and aligns with the user's request. 

      **Final Answer:**  
      \boxed{15}

- What factors contributed to the decline in the total order GTV level during March 2025 compared with the level observed in February 2025? Analyze order activity of franchisees by country.

   Answer:

      The data shows that total order GTV actually **increased** in March 2025 compared to February 2025, with a **+8.8% growth**. Therefore, there is no "decline" to analyze. 

      However, the database response did **not** include country-specific franchisee order activity data. If you'd like an analysis of order activity by country during this period, please clarify whether you want:  
      1. A breakdown of GTV by country for February/March 2025, or  
      2. Insights into regional performance trends.

### Patient21

- What are the main drivers behind the high daily liquidity outflows observed during the last two days of June 2025? Look at large-impact negative transactions to explain the outflows.

   Answer:

      The high daily liquidity outflows observed on the last two days of June 2025 were primarily driven by large negative transactions:

      1. **2025-06-24**  
         - **Total negative volume**: €-1,715,055.33  
         - **Largest impact**: A single transaction of €-1,700,000.95 from account `DE06********0200 EUR` dominated the outflow.  

      2. **2025-06-25**  
         - **Total negative volume**: €-3,388,309.69  
         - **Largest impact**: The largest transaction was €-371,981.16 from account `DE58********9400 EUR`, though multiple smaller negative transactions likely contributed to the higher total.  

      These large negative transactions appear to be the primary drivers of the liquidity outflows during those days.

- What is the average variation in end-of-month total liquidity balances during the six-month period before March 2025 ?

   Answer:

      The average monthly variation in end-of-month total liquidity balances during the six-month period from October 2024 to February 2025 was **−$2.06 million** (a decrease of approximately **$2.06 million per month** on average). This reflects a consistent downward trend in liquidity during the period.

- What is the change in the trend of transaction outflows from March to May 2025 compared to December 2024 to February 2025 for the client headquarters accounts (i.e., the 'patient21_se' legal entity)?

   Answer:

      The total transaction outflows for the **patient21_se** legal entity show a **decrease of €1.5 million** between the two periods:

      - **March–May 2025**: €15,388,237.48 outflow  
      - **December 2024–February 2025**: €18,420,992.67 outflow  

      This represents a **1.5 million euro reduction** (or ~8.3% decrease) in outflows during the March–May 2025 period compared to the prior 5-month window.  

      The results are based on the `saltedge_transactions` table, filtered for negative amounts and the legal entity `Patient21 SE` (case-sensitive). Let me know if you'd like further analysis!
