### Kebony

- What is the current total liquidity level ?
  
  Answer:
  
      **Current Total Liquidity Level (Latest Available Date)**

      | Date       | Total Liquidity (Sum of `upper_bound_balance`) |
      |------------|------------------------------------------------|
      | 2025‑09‑10 | **‑33,616,393.78**                             |

      *The value represents the total sum of the `upper_bound_balance` column for all accounts as of the most recent date available in the `portland.kebony_reference.liquidity` table.*

      The negative figure indicates that, at that point in time, the **combined upper-bound balances across all accounts were net-negative**, reflecting a potential overdraft or shortfall position.

- What is the current total liquidity level of pledged accounts ?
  
  Answer:

      **Current Total Liquidity Level of Pledged Accounts (Upper Bound)**

      | Total Liquidity (Upper Bound) |
      |-------------------------------|
      | **€1,323,958.30**             |

      This value represents the sum of the `upper_bound_balance` for all rows where `is_pledged = TRUE`,  
      based on the most recent date available in the `portland.kebony_reference.liquidity` table.

- What is the difference between the current liquidity position and the liquidity position at the end of last month ?

  Answer:

      **Difference in Liquidity Position**

      | Period                  | Total Liquidity (Upper Bound) |
      |-------------------------|-------------------------------|
      | Current (2025‑08‑28)    | **‑€32,156,624.14**            |
      | End of Last Month (2025‑07‑31) | **‑€29,939,507.94**   |

      ---

      **Calculation**

      Difference = Current liquidity – Last-month liquidity  
      \[
      = -32{,}156{,}624.14 - (-29{,}939{,}507.94)  
      = -2{,}217{,}116.20
      \]

      ---

      **Conclusion**  
      The liquidity position has **decreased by €2,217,116.20** compared to the end of the previous month, based on upper-bound balances.


- What are the top 3 transactions that had the biggest impact on the liquidity over the past week?
  
  Answer:

      I’m ready to help! What would you like to know about the data?

- What is the year-over-year percentage change in average liquidity level for the current month compared to the same month last year ?

  Answer:

      **Year‑over‑Year Percentage Change in Average Liquidity (June 2025 vs. June 2024)**

      | Month      | Avg. Liquidity   | YoY % Change  |
      |------------|------------------|---------------|
      | June 2024  | **‑308,923.28**  | –             |
      | June 2025  | **‑450,341.40**  | **+45.78 %**  |

      ---

      **Interpretation**

      - The average liquidity level for June 2025 is **45.78 % higher** than in June 2024.  
      - This calculation is based on the `upper_bound_balance` column, averaged over all records for each month, using the standard YoY percentage change formula:

      \[
      \text{YoY \% Change} = \frac{\text{Avg}_{2025} - \text{Avg}_{2024}}{\text{Avg}_{2024}} \times 100
      \]

      \[
      = \frac{-450,341.40 - (-308,923.28)}{-308,923.28} \times 100 \approx 45.78\%
      \]

- Is the current total liquidity level close to the facility liquidity covenant? The facility covenant is equal to 20% of total facility outstanding

  Answer:

      **Answer**

      | Metric                                  | Value             | Units                          |
      |----------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
      | Total facility outstanding             | 7,500,000         | EUR                           |
      | Facility liquidity covenant (20 % of outstanding) | 1,500,000         | EUR                           |
      | Current total liquidity (sum of `upper_bound_balance`) | –732,517,880.72  | Mixed currency, summed as-is  |

      ---

      **Conclusion**

      The current total liquidity level is **far below** the facility liquidity covenant.  
      - The covenant requires a minimum liquidity of **1.5 M EUR**.  
      - The aggregated liquidity stands at **–732 M** (negative, indicating net liabilities).

      Therefore, the liquidity position does **not** meet the covenant requirements.

### Taster

- What is the current total liquidity level ?
  
  Answer:

      **Current total liquidity level (latest available date)**  

      | Date       | Total Liquidity (sum of `upper_bound_balance`) |
      |------------|--------------------------------------------------|
      | 2025‑09‑10 | **7,191,446.67**                                 |

      *The value is the sum of the `upper_bound_balance` column across all accounts in the `portland.taster_reference.liquidity` table for the most recent date in the dataset.*

- What is the current total liquidity level of pledged accounts ?
  
  Answer:

      **Current total liquidity level of pledged accounts**

      | Metric                                   | Value  |
      |------------------------------------------|--------|
      | Total pledged liquidity (sum of balances) | **0**  |

      **Explanation**

      - The `portland.taster_reference.liquidity` table contains the most recent snapshot of all accounts (latest date = 2025‑09‑10).  
      - A query filtering for `is_pledged = TRUE` returned **0 rows** – none of the accounts are marked as pledged.  
      - Consequently, the sum of the `upper_bound_balance` (or `lower_bound_balance`) for pledged accounts is zero.

      If you need a different definition of “pledged” or a different balance column, let me know and I can adjust the query.

- What is the current GTV level ?

  Answer:

      I’m ready to help! What would you like to explore or analyze in the data?

- What it is the total number of customers who placed an order this month ?

  Answer:

      **Total number of customers who placed an order this month (August 2025)**

      | Month       | Total distinct customers |
      |-------------|--------------------------|
      | August 2025 | **272,091**              |

      The count was obtained by joining the `orders` table with the `orders_customers` table on the order ID, filtering for orders dated between 2025‑08‑01 (inclusive) and 2025‑09‑01 (exclusive), and counting distinct `customer_id` values.

- What is the difference between the current liquidity position and the liquidity position at the end of last month ?

  Answer:

      **Liquidity Position Difference**

      | Period                     | Total Liquidity (upper‑bound balance) |
      |----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
      | Current (latest available date) | **7,191,446.67**                  |
      | End of last month (2025‑08‑31)  | **1,864,748.30**                  |

      **Difference**

      \[
      7{,}191{,}446.67 \;-\; 1{,}864{,}748.30 \;=\; \mathbf{5{,}326{,}698.37}
      \]

      So, the liquidity position has increased by **$5,326,698.37** from the end of August to the most recent snapshot (2025‑09‑10).

- What are the top 3 transactions that had the biggest impact on the liquidity over the past week?
  
  Answer:

      **Top 3 transactions that had the biggest impact on liquidity in the past week (23 – 29 May 2025)**

      | Rank | Date       | Transaction ID         | Account ID           | Amount (EUR)  | Description (excerpt)                                                                                         | Category |
      |-------|------------|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
      | 1     | 2025‑05‑29 | 1552463508946291132   | 1212483560926088044  | **286 075.37** | *VIR RECU 5981903744S DE: Deliveroo France SAS REF: 1050FR6Q7CI*                                            | orders   |
      | 2     | 2025‑05‑28 | 1551633547620518887   | 1212483560926088044  | **261 230.61** | *VIR RECU 5886437928S DE: STRIPE MOTIF: STRIPE REF: STRIPE‑2XQ3PMGORF2VZA13GCZZG2FZ9TYU PROVENANCE: NL Pays Bas* | orders   |

      These three entries are the largest absolute‑value transactions recorded in the `classified_transactions` table for the week of 23 – 29 May 2025, and therefore would have had the most significant direct impact on the liquidity balances shown in the `liquidity` table.

- Who are the top 3 concepts contributing the most to GTV level this month ?

  Answer:

      **Top 3 concepts driving GTV for the current month**

      | Rank | Concept      | GTV (EUR)    |
      |-------|--------------|--------------|
      | 1     | Pepe Chicken | **461,960.74** |
      | 2     | Starsmash   | **35,179.25**  |
      | 3     | Spud Bros   | **17,268.52**  |

      These figures come from the `revenues` table, aggregated by `concept_label` for all records dated within the current calendar month.

- What is the year-over-year percentage change in average liquidity level for the current month compared to the same month last year ?

  Answer:

        **Year‑over‑Year Change in Average Liquidity (Upper‑Bound Balance)**

      | Period                      | Avg. Upper‑Bound Balance | YoY % Change |
      |-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
      | Current month (Sep 2025)     | **$671,679.11**          | –            |
      | Same month last year (Sep 2024) | **$997,614.16**          | –            |
      | YoY % change                 | –                        | **−32.7 %**  |

      **Calculation**

      \[
      \text{YoY \%} = \frac{671{,}679.11 - 997{,}614.16}{997{,}614.16} \times 100
                    \approx -32.7\%
      \]

      So, the average liquidity level in September 2025 is **about 32.7 % lower** than in September 2024.

- Is the current total liquidity level close to the facility liquidity covenant? The facility covenant is equal to 1M €

  Answer:

      **Current Liquidity vs. Facility Covenant**

      | Metric                             | Value (EUR)      |
      |----------------------------------|------------------|
      | Facility covenant                 | 1 000 000        |
      | Total upper‑bound liquidity (latest date) | **7 447 218.92** |
      | Total lower‑bound liquidity (latest date) | **7 445 706.82** |

      **Interpretation**

      - The current total liquidity (≈ 7.45 M EUR) is **well above** the facility covenant of 1 M EUR.
      - The liquidity is roughly 7.5× the covenant threshold, so it is **not close** to the covenant limit.

## 2. Querying with Context

### Kebony

      **Summary of How the Result Was Obtained**

      1. Reviewed the `portland.kebony_reference.liquidity` table to verify column names and data types.  
      2. Queried the table for the most recent date (`2025‑09‑10`) and summed the `lower_bound_balance_in_covenant_currency` column.  
      3. Returned the resulting aggregated value as the current total liquidity level.

- What is the current total liquidity level of pledged accounts ?
  
  Answer:

      **Current Total Liquidity Level of Pledged Accounts**

      - **Date:** 2025‑09‑10  
      - **Total Liquidity (Lower Bound, Covenant Currency):** **€184,598.21**

      **How the Result Was Obtained**

      A read-only query was executed on the `portland.kebony_reference.liquidity` table,  
      summing the `lower_bound_balance_in_covenant_currency` for all rows where `is_pledged = TRUE`.  

      The results were grouped by date, ordered in descending order, and the most recent date (**2025‑09‑10**) was selected.

- What is the difference between the current liquidity position and the liquidity position at the end of last month ?

  Answer:

      **Key Result**

      - **Difference between current liquidity position (2025‑09‑10) and end‑of‑last‑month position (2025‑08‑31):**  
        **‑€355,276.16** (in covenant currency, lower‑bound balances)

      **How the Result Was Obtained**

      1. Queried the `portland.kebony_reference.liquidity` table for two dates:  
        - Most recent date: `2025‑09‑10`  
        - Previous month-end: `2025‑08‑31`

      2. Summed the `lower_bound_balance_in_covenant_currency` for each date to obtain total liquidity positions.

      3. Computed the difference between the two totals:
      1,595,240.96 (2025‑09‑10) – 1,950,417.12 (2025‑08‑31) = -355,276.16

      The negative result indicates that the current liquidity position is **lower** than it was at the end of the previous month.

        - Aggregated the `lower_bound_balance_in_covenant_currency` per day.

      2. **Monthly Averages**  
        - **September 2025**:  
          - Total sum of daily balances: €17,109,303.87 (across 10 days)  
          - **Average ≈ €1,710,930.39**
        - **September 2024**:  
          - Total sum of daily balances: €222,225,289.49 (across 30 days)  
          - **Average ≈ €7,407,509.65**

      3. **Year-over-Year Percentage Change**

        \[
        \frac{1{,}710{,}930.39 - 7{,}407{,}509.65}{7{,}407{,}509.65} \times 100
        = -76.86\%
        \]

      ---

      The result shows that the **average liquidity level in September 2025** is approximately **76.86 % lower** than in **September 2024**, based on the lower-bound covenant currency values.

- Is the current total liquidity level close to the facility liquidity covenant? The facility covenant is equal to 20% of total facility outstanding

  Answer:

      **Key Elements**

      | Item                                                        | Value               |
      |-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|

      ---

      **How the Results Were Obtained**

      1. **Facility Outstanding**  
        Queried the `credit_facility_ledger` table to sum the `amount` for the most recent date (`2025‑04‑07`):

        ```sql
        SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_facility_outstanding
        FROM "portland"."kebony_reference"."credit_facility_ledger"
        WHERE date = (
          SELECT MAX(date)
          FROM "portland"."kebony_reference"."credit_facility_ledger"
        );
        ```

      Result: €7,500,000.00
      2. Facility Covenant
        Calculated as 20 % of the outstanding facility:
        €7,500,000 × 0.20 = €1,500,000.00

      3. Current Total Liquidity
        Queried the liquidity table to sum the lower_bound_balance_in_covenant_currency for the most recent date (2025‑09‑10):

        ```sql
        SELECT SUM(lower_bound_balance_in_covenant_currency) AS total_liquidity
        FROM "portland"."kebony_reference"."liquidity"
        WHERE date = (
          SELECT MAX(date)
          FROM "portland"."kebony_reference"."liquidity"
        );
        ```

      4. Comparison
      The current liquidity level (€1,595,240.96) is above the covenant threshold (€1,500,000.00), indicating compliance.

      *These are the three largest‑by‑absolute‑value entries in the `classified_transactions` table for the period 2025‑09‑04 – 2025‑09‑10 (the most recent 7 days). All three are inbound “orders” payments, so they represent the most substantial single‑day inflows that would have moved the cash‑position balances shown in the `liquidity` table.*

      ---

      ### How the figures were derived

      1. Queried the `classified_transactions` table for the last 7 days (`date >= DATE '2025-09-04'`).  
      2. Calculated the absolute value of each transaction amount (`abs_amount`).  
      3. Sorted by `abs_amount` descending and selected the top 3 rows.  

      The resulting amounts are the largest single‑transaction movements that would have most directly altered the daily liquidity balances recorded in the `liquidity` table.

- Who are the top 3 concepts contributing the most to GTV level this month ?

  Answer:

        **Top 3 concepts contributing the most to GTV (1 Sep 2025 – 11 Sep 2025)**  

      | Rank | Concept      | GTV (EUR)    |
      |-------|--------------|--------------|
      | 1     | Pepe Chicken | 4 373 464.52 |
      | 2     | Starsmash    | 324 464.72   |
      | 3     | Out Fry      | 107 824.59   |

      **How the result was obtained**

      1. Queried the `portland.taster_reference.orders` table.  
      2. Filtered rows to the most recent available dates (2025‑09‑01 to 2025‑09‑11).  
      3. Aggregated GTV by `concept_label`, summing the `gtv` column.  
      4. Sorted the totals in descending order and limited to the top 3.  

      The query used:

      ```sql
      SELECT "concept_label", SUM("gtv") AS total_gtv
      FROM "portland"."taster_reference"."orders"
      WHERE "date" >= DATE '2025-09-01' AND "date" <= DATE '2025-09-11'
      GROUP BY "concept_label"
      ORDER BY total_gtv DESC
      LIMIT 3;
      ```

- What is the year-over-year percentage change in average liquidity level for the current month compared to the same month last year ?

  Answer:

      **Key Elements**

      | Metric                                           | 2025‑09 (average) | 2024‑09 (average) | YoY % change  |
      |-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
      | Average liquidity (lower bound, covenant currency) | **703,209.04**    | **1,046,426.13**  | **−32.80 %**  |

      **Summary of how the result was obtained**

      1. **Table inspected** – `portland.taster_reference.liquidity` to confirm column names and data types.  
      2. **Query executed** – calculated the average of `lower_bound_balance_in_covenant_currency` for:  
        * September 2025 (`date` between 2025‑09‑01 and 2025‑09‑30)  
        * September 2024 (`date` between 2024‑09‑01 and 2024‑09‑30)  
      3. **Percentage change** – \((\text{avg2025} - \text{avg2024}) / \text{avg2024} \times 100\).  
      4. **Result** – a YoY decline of approximately **32.8 %** in average liquidity for the current month compared to the same month last year.

- Is the current total liquidity level close to the facility liquidity covenant? The facility covenant is equal to 1M €

  Answer:

      **Key elements**

      | Item                             | Value           |
      |---------------------------------|-----------------|
      | Current total liquidity (latest date) | **€7,445,706.82** |
      | Facility liquidity covenant      | **€1,000,000**   |
      | Difference                      | **€6,445,706.82** |
      | Ratio (liquidity / covenant)    | **7.45×**        |

      **Answer**

      No – the current total liquidity level is **well above** the facility liquidity covenant. The liquidity is roughly 7.5 times the covenant amount, exceeding it by about €6.4 million.

      **How the result was obtained**

      1. Queried the `portland.taster_reference.liquidity` table, summing the `lower_bound_balance_in_covenant_currency` for the most recent date (`2025-09-10`).  
      2. The sum returned €7,445,706.82.  
      3. Compared this figure to the covenant value of €1,000,000 to compute the difference and ratio.
